Tech+ Mentorship Program connects 1st- and 2nd-year UWaterloo students with experienced and passionate upper-years from different domains in tech, and fosters this community through events that bring everyone together.
  
  Coffee chats are an opportunity for students to connect with multiple upper-year mentors knowledgeable in the topics and domains they're interested in. Students will have their questions answered, learn about different career paths within tech, and add a new connection to their network. New to W21, Coffee Chats is now opening the floor up for matches across all years and programs!
      
    The Mentorship Program pairs students wanting to find their place within the tech industry, either as a beginner or someone looking to transition, with an upper-year mentor. Mentors will provide guidance, offer insight and act as a resource in their mentee's introduction to the tech industry. We hope to create a culture that encourages individuality and personal growth. The Mentorship Program facilitates the matching of pairs and introduces participants to the larger Tech+ community.
